But departmentAbbrevation and departmentName cannot be both part of the key so departmentName will still be the key but departmentAbbrevation is unique. programmeName -> programmeAbbrevationThe name of the programme will be shortened to a abbrevation. A programme will have a unique name but the abbrevation is not neceraily unique.studentLoginID -> programmeName branchName studentName studentIDNbrDoes not violate any normalforms. studentLoginID is a key and so is programmeName and branchName, the rest are nonkeys. studentIDNbr -> studentLoginIDViolates 3NF but studentIDNbr is unique in a higher sense than studentLoginID. We cannot edit the value of a studentIDNbr but we can choose the value of studentLoginID which will also be unique at the university and is choosen from the students name and/or ID number. (Two students cannot have identical usernames). If we add the fact that passing unisserarily around a persons ID number around on the internet question of privacy we chose to have studentLoginID as a key and the studentIDNbr as unique.studentLoginID courseCode -> gradeDoes not violate any normalforms. Looks identical to the ÓCompletedÓ relationship in our schema. courseCode -> courseName courseCredits courseCategory courseCapacityDoes not violate any normalforms. courseCode is a key and the rest are nonkeys.courseCode placeInQueue -> studentLoginIDstudentLoginID courseCode -> placeInQueueDoes not violate any normalforms. Proves that given a place in the queue and a course code we will know who holds that spot in the queue and that only one student can hold it. This is because given a studentLoginID and a courseCode we get where in the queue the student is for the specific courseCode.
